# U-Read-Bolt
It is commonly known that the more precise the signal the human brain focuses on, the more efficiently it can process it.
Therefore it has come to my attention that the brain can recognize words and read them faster if displayed one bit at a time than the usual way of book reading.

Based on this "sudo-science", I built this website that takes an essay or a relatively small pdf file and makes you read it word by word, which although might not be necessary in most cases, takes the stand of a good option when the brain is zoning out while reading.
